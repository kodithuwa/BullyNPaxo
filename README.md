**PAXOS Consensus Algorithm for Distributed Systems**
Paxos is an algorithm that enables a distributed set of computers (for example, a cluster of distributed database nodes) to achieve consensus over an asynchronous network. 
To achieve agreement, one or more of the computers proposes a value to Paxos. 
Consensus is achieved when a majority of the computers running Paxos agrees on one of the proposed values.

Outline Approach 

Choose project based on digit sum of the Index Number - MS21930768
21930768 -> 2 + 1 + 9 + 3 + 0 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 36 => 36  => 3 + 6 => 9/2  Modulus  1 =>Use Case 1
